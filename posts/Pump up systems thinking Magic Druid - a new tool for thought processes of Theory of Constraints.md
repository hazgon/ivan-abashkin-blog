# Introduction

Have you ever felt stuck in your job or personal life? Did you feel like you're caught in a vicious circle that you can't get out of? If so, you're not alone. Our entire life consists of conflicts and seemingly insurmountable situations. But not in the Theory of Constraints!

One of the key pillars of TOC states that there are no real conflicts - any contradiction can be resolved. Most ordinary problems disappear if you can clearly formulate the contradiction at their root. More complex conflicts are resolved using the "Stormy Cloud" tool. But in any case - first the conflict must be formulated. This often presents problems. The new TOC thought processes tool "Magic Druid" greatly facilitates the search for conflict and the underlying contradiction. 

In this article, we will discuss what Magic Druids are, how to use them, and how they can help you in life and work.

# Video

By the way, [Dmitry Egorov](https://egorovde.ru/) and I recorded a video podcast about Magic Druids. If you prefer to watch rather than read, follow this [link](https://youtu.be/rQXW_W6iptc): 

[![Magic Druids. A new cognitive tool of the Theory of Constraints](https://img.youtube.com/vi/rQXW_W6iptc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQXW_W6iptc)

In the podcast, we dissected this tool with examples and practice of its application. It turned out to be interesting!

# Section 1: Who are Magic Druids?

## General concept 

Magic Druid is a new tool of thought processes, recently published in the Body of Knowledge of the International Organization for Theory of Constraints Certification ([TOCICO Body of knowledge](https://www.tocico.org/page/TOCBodyofKnowledge)).
It helps visualize a recurring conflict or problem. 

The Druid consists of two sets of blocks, united by cause-and-effect relationships. On the left side is one side of the situation. On the right side is the other. The point is that one side creates and maintains the existence of the other. This is a very strong structure, which reproduces itself over and over again, making us move in a closed circle from which there is no escape.

![](res/Magic%20Druids%201.png)

The goal of the tool is to identify and clearly show both sides of the dilemma so that you can analyze the situation and come up with ways to get out of the closed cycle. The Druid also helps to direct a heated and often fruitless argument in a constructive direction, relieving participants of the need to fight each other and directing their efforts to combat a common problem.

## Why such a name?

The name of the tool seems to have appeared under the influence of two concepts. 
1. The first is the TOC cognitive tools, which consist mostly of logical trees. In computer games, Druids are a class of characters associated with nature, trees, and wisdom. It turns out that they live in our forests of logical trees and guard them with their wisdom.
2. The second is the battle of two strong wizards. They shoot at each other with two beams of energy, which explode in the middle when they meet. And so these two fight, sparks fly, curses, each tries to shout out his "spell" louder to defeat the enemy: "SALES!" "STOCKS!" "CUSTOMERS!" "MARKET!", but the battle is equal, mana runs out for both and both exhausted and disappointed go to the corners until next time.

Magic Druids are created to overcome the difficulty in building Current Reality Trees and formulating the Stormy Cloud. 

According to the observations of experts teaching TOC thought processes, many students after training cannot use these tools to solve their practical tasks. The process of diagnostics, problem definition and cloud construction requires significant mental energy, especially for beginners. Many people find this process so intimidating that they break out in a cold sweat when you suggest they repeat it.

Magic Druids come to the rescue. These tools simplify the initial stages of thought processes, making them accessible even to those who are not familiar with this methodology. There have been cases where the simplicity of the tool has led to it spreading like wildfire throughout the organization as a new way of communication.

With Magic Druids, identifying key issues becomes a simple task. And once the problem is defined, it is easy to convert it into a Current Reality Tree or a "Stormy Cloud" diagram.

## Druid Theory

Let's see what such a dilemma described through a Druid might look like. 

People argued and learned to negotiate from the beginning of time. Even in primitive society, it was necessary to somehow solve problems of communal life. 

Let's imagine what the dialogue between two cave people faced with a security dilemma might look like.

- Throw a rock at that saber-toothed tiger!
- But then it will chase us!
- But otherwise the tiger will stay near the cave!
- But it can attack us!
- Otherwise, it will attack our family members!
- But we can die!
- And our family members can die!

![Cave people argue about a tiger](res/Пещерные%20люди%20спорят%20по%20поводу%20тигра.png)

The Druid consists of two parts - left and right. Usually, four cause-and-effect steps are described in each part. This is not a dogma, but practice has shown that four steps are suitable for most cases. Fewer steps poorly describe the conflict, and more often do not bring significant value.

![Magic Druids 2](res/Magic%20Druids%202.png)

The steps are read from bottom to top and around, as follows:
- We must throw stones at the saber-toothed tiger
- If we do so, we will attract his attention
- If we attract the tiger's attention, it may attack us
- If the tiger attacks us, we may die!
- To not die, we must not throw stones at the saber-toothed tiger
- If we don't throw stones at the tiger, it will stay by the cave
- If the tiger stays at the cave, it may attack members of our family
- If the tiger attacks our family members, they may die!
- Therefore, we must throw stones at the saber-toothed tiger ...

The two orange blocks at the bottom of the Druid describe our behavior. What we do or should do.

The green blocks in the middle of the Druid are the intermediate steps for explaining our logic. 
The lower green block records some undesirable consequence of our behavior that personally affects us.
The upper green block describes the development of this consequence, the magnitude of undesirability increases.
If you don't have enough green blocks to explain the situation - add more.

The two top red blocks describe the violation of our needs or goals. What we would like to avoid so that our goals are met.

![Magic Druids 3](res/Magic%20Druids%203.png)

Note that the violation of our needs or goals on one side forces us to take action on the other side.

This is the negative feedback of the system, which does not allow us to solve the problem and aggravates it over and over again.

Here's a way to look at the structure of the Druid through the prism of a systems approach.

![Magic Druids 4](res/Magic%20Druids%204.png)

- Our actions lead to some consequences that personally affect us.
- How our actions affect us is reflected in our local subsystem.
- The impact on our local subsystem is reflected in the whole system as a whole.
- To avoid or reduce the negative impact on the entire system, we are forced to take some other action

![Magic Druids 5](res/Magic%20Druids%205.png)


Let's look at another example

![Magic Druids 6](res/Magic%20Druids%206.png)

The author of this Druid travels a lot for work. His trips are quite long - about a week. 
Every time he prepares for a trip, he faces a dilemma: to take luggage or to get by with only hand luggage.

- There is a desire to take only hand luggage
- We know that hand luggage is limited to seven kilograms, so we can't fit everything we want in it. 
- Therefore, we need to take only the essentials.
- If we take only the essentials, then during the trip we begin to suffer from the lack of something.
- Therefore, we have a desire next time to take luggage with us
- When we decide to take luggage with us, we use all the free space, filling it to the brim.
- A full suitcase becomes heavy
- The heavy suitcase has to be dragged everywhere, and this is very hard for us.
- Therefore, there is a desire next time to try to manage only with hand luggage ...

When we visualize a dilemma or conflict in such an explicit way, several interesting effects arise:
1. "Obvious" solutions start to suggest themselves. Many of the dilemmas can be solved at this stage.
2. It becomes possible to discuss the dilemma with other people.
3. There is an opportunity to think about beliefs or justifications (arrows) in the logical connections between blocks. Breaking even one connection can get us out of this endless cycle!

The author of this Druid solved his conflict like this: take a bag slightly larger than hand luggage, add the missing items to it, and check it in as baggage. It's easier on the plane and there's less to carry yourself!

## Conclusion

Druids are a cool way of critical thinking. They allow us to identify conflicts from everyday hustle and bustle and problems that torment us on a regular basis, clearly visualize them, and systematically think about the problem.

The beauty of Magic Druids is that anyone can use them, even an unprepared person. The process is not difficult to understand, it is easy to learn.
And when the Druid is formulated, the solution often comes by itself.

For more complex cases that cannot be solved in one or two steps, the Theory of Constraints offers additional tools: the Current Reality Tree (CRT) and the Conflict Resolution Diagram (Storm Cloud). And Magic Druids can significantly facilitate their use. Read about it in the second part of the article.

# Section 2: Magic Druids in Practice

Let's see how this tool can be used in real life.

This section will have two parts.

The first is about how Druids can be applied in everyday life. In what life scenarios can Druids be useful?

The second part will be for advanced readers who are familiar with the basic TOC thinking tools. We will look at how Druids can help us analyze complex situations. How they can facilitate the identification of the root conflict and the formulation of the Current Reality Tree.

## Part 1: Druids in everyday life

Conflicts, problems, dilemmas surround us constantly. Often we get so used to them that we stop noticing.

Meanwhile, behind each such problem hides an unresolved conflict that prevents it from evaporating on its own. Something constantly feeds it.

Use the tool if you regularly encounter an unpleasant situation. It will highlight the chain of events that lead to the problem not going away, but being reproduced over and over again.

To formulate a Druid, you can go from the problem. And you can go from the action we take.

It doesn't matter where to start the path, if everything is done correctly, we will get two branches of the Druid, which will reproduce each other over and over again.

To make it easier to formulate a Druid, you can use this list of questions:

1. What do I do or need to do?
2. And why not do it that way?
   What will be wrong if we do it this way? 
   How does it affect us personally?
3. And what will it lead to? What's bad about it overall? What's bad about it for our department?
4. And what will be bad in the end? How will the entire system suffer? What will be wrong for the entire organization?
5. So we need to do what?
6. And why not do it that way?
   What will be wrong if we do it this way? 
   How does it affect us personally?
7. And what will it lead to? What's bad about it overall? What's bad about it for our department?
8. And what will be bad in the end? How will the entire system suffer? What will be wrong for the entire organization?

![Magic Druids 7](res/Magic%20Druids%207.png)

Please note: actions are at the bottom. And on top, such important needs are violated that we have a burning desire to take the opposite action.

After drawing the Druid, you can think about how to break this infinite figure-eight. 

Many situations can be resolved at this stage. If this nut did not crack so easily, you can move on to the next stage.

Each block is somehow connected with its predecessor and descendant. If we manage to break this connection, we will break this endless cycle.  Our beliefs stand behind each arrow. They explain why we believe that the upper block necessarily follows from the lower one. If we clearly describe these beliefs, we can criticize them and try to challenge them. Perhaps some of them are no longer relevant, outdated, have become irrelevant to the current situation?

To make it easier to formulate such beliefs, you can use the verbal formula. "I believe that 2 follows from 1 because" and then list why we think so.

![Magic Druids 8](res/Magic%20Druids%208.png)

In practice, a Druid with written beliefs for each cause-and-effect relationship looks something like the picture below.

![Magic Druids 9](res/Magic%20Druids%209.png)

Look at the wording of your beliefs. Try to question each point. Is it really so? Always? In all cases?

You will surely find such points that you want to argue. There will surely be those that can be "hacked" and a workaround can be devised. 
This will be the key to solving the Druid.

If you manage to "destroy" all the beliefs behind any arrow, it means you broke the link between causes and consequences in this place. The circle is broken, and you can calmly do the opposite side of the Druid. 
If all the links withstood, then relying on the points that have been questioned, you can develop a set of measures that will significantly reduce the violation of the two red needs. Or even ensure their full compliance. 

For the example above, such a set of measures could be:
- Move to live in a place next to the office
- Change the way of commuting to work so that it gives strength and brings pleasure
- Build processes in the organization in such a way that quality communications are ensured with online tools 
- Review work processes so that they do not require an instant reaction from one person 
- and so on.

By the way, nothing prevents you from implementing all the found solutions at once! =)


Depending on the type of situation, you can approach the Druid from different sides. Sometimes it's convenient to start with actions. Sometimes it's convenient to go from problems. Let's look at an example of how to act depending on the type of problem you're thinking about.

### Druids for solving explicit dilemmas

Below we will consider typical cases when using Druids can be useful.

Often, life presents us with a choice of "either this or that." And this choice can be quite difficult to make. If you've encountered such a dilemma, Druid can help you a lot.

First of all, clearly write out conflicting actions. Between what and what are we forced to choose?
![Magic Druids 10](res/Magic%20Druids%2010.png)

Over each action, write down the answer to the question: "How does this affect us personally? What bad will happen from these actions?" 

![Magic Druids 11](res/Magic%20Druids%2011.png)

Now to the new actions again ask the question: "And what will the waste of extra money and the lack of good rest lead to? What's bad about this?"

![Magic Druids 12](res/Magic%20Druids%2012.png)

And finally for each column try to formulate an answer to the question: "What will be bad globally? What kind of trouble will happen?"

![Magic Druids 13](res/Magic%20Druids%2013.png)

Now check that the global pains you wrote at the top are really so burning that they cause a strong desire to take action at the bottom of the opposite column. If necessary, rewrite the thesis or correct the wording.

### Druids for solving the causes of constant "fires" that need to be put out.

Let's look at how to build a Druid in situations when we face the need to drop everything and react to a sudden event (firefighting):

An IT company has discovered a critical error in its product. After the last update, one of the key functions of the product broke down. Technical support is getting overwhelmed with calls from angry users. All the developers' efforts are now focused on patching the hole as soon as possible. But as soon as the dust settles, we need to figure out why these situations are happening in the first place.

Let's look at the main negative factor that we are observing right now.

![Magic Druids 14](res/Magic%20Druids%2014.png)

This factor forces us to act! In order to avoid such situations in the future, we need to thoroughly check every release!

![Magic Druids 15](res/Magic%20Druids%2015.png)


Next, we act analogously to the previous example: we ask the question "What's bad?" and we come to a significant global undesirability.

![Magic Druids 16](res/Magic%20Druids%2016.png)

It ultimately leads us to the opposite action that supports the initial undesirable effect.

![Magic Druids 17](res/Magic%20Druids%2017.png)

As you can see, you can start building a Magic Druid from any convenient place. You just move through the structure, use the auxiliary questions, and step by step you get a visualized conflict.

### Druids for facilitation and documenting meetings

Another case where Druid can be useful is monitoring a discussion and documenting it.

Often in meetings we encounter a situation where two opposing views on a certain issue meet and a heated debate breaks out.

- We need to do this!
- No, we need to do this!
- But then this will happen!
- But if we don't do this, this will happen!
- etc.

Each side sticks to its position and is unwilling to back down. Such conversations can take a long time, go in circles for a long time and often end in nothing.

With Druid, you can describe the conversation and understand the reason for the dispute. Then you can ask clarifying questions and steer the conversation in a constructive direction.

The completed Druid will show the participants the subject of the dispute. This will shift the focus of the conversation to finding a solution that satisfies everyone. People's energy will be directed towards fighting the common enemy - the dilemma, not each other.

Try to carefully follow the conversation. You will notice that one participant puts forward a thesis, and the other immediately refutes it. This looks like a chain of theses and counter-theses. Statement - objection.

Here is an example of such a conversation.

A: Let's replace our task tracker!
B: No, we can't, all our business processes are built in the current task tracker
A: But it's impossible to use! It has a heavy interface, nothing is clear and inconvenient!
B: We can't switch because we don't know if we can replicate the business processes in another tool.
A: If we stick with the current tracker, we will continue to suffer.
B: If we start dealing with this, we will spend a lot of time and effort with an unclear result.
A: People don't want to use it. Because of this, communication and agreements suffer.
B: We don't have the resources to deal with this. Other work will suffer and it's not clear if we can find something better.

Based on this conversation, you can formulate such a Druid:

![Magic Druids 18](res/Magic%20Druids%2018.png)

The conversation chain relative to the Druid looks something like this.

![Magic Druids 19](res/Magic%20Druids%2019.png)

Of course, people don't always communicate in exactly this sequence. When documenting a conversation, just remember the actions, their justifications, and the objections of the other side. Having recorded the arguments of each side separately, you can try to overlay them on the Druid template (see bonuses at the end of the article). This will help to formulate the contradiction from the theses of the conversation that sparked the discussion.

### Druids for solving regularly recurring problems

There is another category of problems that are convenient to solve through Druids. These are problems that we constantly observe. These problems have already greatly annoyed us, but for some reason they are still unresolved. The most powerful systemic conflicts usually stand behind such problems. And often one Druid is not enough to identify them. For this, heavier tools may be needed. We will talk about them below.


## Part 2: Advanced Druids

This part of the article will be useful to those who are already familiar with the thought tools of the Theory of Constraints. I will try to explain how the new tool fits into the set of existing knowledge. 

If you are not familiar with TOC thought processes, but you are interested, I recommend familiarizing yourself with the [TOCICO Handbook](https://www.tocico.org/general/custom.asp?page=toc_handbook) and the [TOCICO term dictionary](https://bipulse.ru/app/dictionary).

Druids complement the first stages of the standard [U-shape](https://bipulse.ru/app/dictionary/docs/U-%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0) algorithm. They work at the stages of "[Why change](https://bipulse.ru/app/dictionary/docs/%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BC%20%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8F%D1%82%D1%8C)" and "[What to change](https://bipulse.ru/app/dictionary/docs/%D1%87%D1%82%D0%BE%20%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8F%D1%82%D1%8C)", replacing the process of finding UDEs and detecting the root conflict, offering an alternative way of describing the problem of existing reality.

### Druid and Stormy Cloud

Magic Druid and Stormy Cloud (evaporating cloud, EC) are very similar tools. They both identify and visualize a contradiction, a conflict. With Magic Druid it is easier to find and formulate it, and Stormy Cloud is better suited for a more substantial and deep elaboration.

Essentially, Magic Druid is the tail of the Cloud, described in detail through negative formulations. This allows you to easily convert one diagram to another. To do this, from each violation of the goal (red on the illustrations) you need to formulate the opposite in meaning need. Not enough money? Hence the need for money. Something is wrong with the resources? The need for resources. Etc.

![Magic Druids 20](res/Magic%20Druids%2020.png)

Now this need needs to be placed under the action from the opposite column and formulate a common goal for them.

![Magic Druids 21](res/Magic%20Druids%2021.png)

As you can see, the actions turn into D and D\` clouds, the needs into B and C, and we must formulate the common goal ourselves, the Druid is not our helper here.

![Magic Druids 22](res/Magic%20Druids%2022.png)

Then we act as usual. We check the cloud, hone the formulations, write out the initial assumptions, question them and come up with a solution.

The value of the Druid here is that you can get a quality cloud much faster than the usual way (through the UDE tree) and at the same time save a lot of thought fuel. From experience, it takes from 5 to 30 minutes to formulate a conflict.

### Druids and CRT

The Current Reality Tree (CRT) is used in the diagnosis of the root problem to demonstrate the need for changes. If you use Magic Druids at this stage, they can greatly help both in building a CRT and in identifying the root problem. For this, it is proposed to build from 3 to 7 Druids, describing unresolved conflicts in the current situation.

![Magic Druids 23](res/Magic%20Druids%2023.png)

During the conversation, you can even provoke participants into heated arguments, throwing them hot topics for discussion. While they argue - we record the course of the conversation and formulate the Druid. As soon as the Druid is clear, you can move on to the next hot topic.

If the test subjects "are not pricking at all", you can start writing down the arguments of one of the sides on the board. The other side, seeing that only the opponent's arguments are recorded, will start to object and demand that their position be written down as well.

As soon as the set of Druids is prepared - divide the halves of the Druid and place them side by side in meaning.

![Magic Druids 25](res/Magic%20Druids%2025.png)

Then we work with these halves. The "floors" of the Druids need to be coordinated with each other. To do this, place similar blocks at the same levels.

![Magic Druids 26](res/Magic%20Druids%2026.png)

At the top, combine the top parts of the halves into a common violation of the system goal. For each half its own.
For example, for goal violations: "my work process is very costly", "costs for materials are rising" and "I spend a lot of money on tool support" the violation of the common goal can be "the costs for the project are too high".

At the bottom, combine all actions into a key driver - some common action that needs to be done for each half.
For example, for actions: "hire qualified workers", "build from high-quality materials" and "regularly service equipment" the common driver can be the action "deliver high value to users".

![Magic Druids 27](res/Magic%20Druids%2027.png)

At this stage, you can check the logic and formulations with the help of [CLR](https://bipulse.ru/app/dictionary/docs/%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B8%20%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BA%D0%B8%20%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%85%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B9) (categories of legitimate reservation).

Now each goal violation needs to be reformulated into a need. The need is the inverted violation of the goals.
For example: "my business is not growing" is reformulated into the need "to ensure business growth", and "the costs of manufacturing projects are too high" is reformulated into the need "to earn more money from the project".

![Magic Druids 28](res/Magic%20Druids%2028.png)

Place the formulated needs under the actions. Place the need from the left side under the right action. Place the need from the right side under the left action.

![Magic Druids 29](res/Magic%20Druids%2029.png)

Answer the question "For what purpose do we need to fulfill the need on the left and the need on the right?" and we get a classic cloud.

![Magic Druids 30](res/Magic%20Druids%2030.png)

As a result, you get a CRT with a conflict at the bottom.

In essence, the process of combining halves of the Druid is a good alternative to the method of concatenation of three clouds. In my opinion, it turns out to be easier, and besides, you immediately get a ready-made CRT of good quality, and even with negative feedback.

# Section 3: How to start using Magic Druids

In this section, I have to disappoint you. The information from this article alone will not benefit you. You have received only information, but this is not enough to benefit from the article. You also need practice and training.

I strongly recommend that you try to apply the Magic Druids approach to real tasks and solve problems that you face with their help. To make it easier, I have prepared several bonuses.

## Bonus 1. Print Template.

Here is a [link](res/magic%20druid%20template.pdf) to a PDF file. Print it on an A4 sheet and then cut it into 4 parts. You will get four sheets with a template for creating a Druid. Carry them with you and if you need to think about a problem, try doing it by answering the questions in the blocks.

The template will facilitate the beginning of thinking about the problem, focus thoughts and help in visualizing the contradiction of your situation.

## Bonus 2. Prompt hint for ChatGPT.

Here is a [link](res/prompt-подсказка%20ChatGPT%20для%20создания%20волшебного%20друида.txt) to a text file with a prompt. Download it and open it in a text editor. Inside the file is a hint text that can be inserted into a chat with an artificial intelligence.

The last lines of the file can be modified to generate new examples or to help formulate a Druid specifically for your situation.

In the GPT-3.5 model, the logic is a bit lame. It can be used for brainstorming and generating new ideas.
The GPT-4 model copes perfectly. Just describe your situation to it and it will generate a Druid for it! Then ask it to help solve the conflict and most likely you will get a ready-made solution to your problem or a good hint!

## Try and train!

If it will be difficult at first - don't give up trying. On the second, third, fourth time, you will definitely be able to describe the problem and think about the solution. The more Druids you solve, the easier it will be to solve them in the future. Don't stop training and each time you will do better and better!
